Date Values
Dates are represented as the number of days since 1970-01-01, with negative values for earlier dates.

# use as.Date( ) to convert strings to dates 
mydates <- as.Date(c("2007-06-22", "2004-02-13"))
# number of days between 6/22/07 and 2/13/04 
days <- mydates[1] - mydates[2]

Sys.Date( ) returns today's date. 
date() returns the current date and time.

The following symbols can be used with the format( ) function to print dates.

Symbol	Meaning	Example
%d	day as a number (0-31)	01-31
%a
%A	abbreviated weekday 
unabbreviated weekday	Mon
Monday
%m	month (00-12)	00-12
%b
%B	abbreviated month
unabbreviated month	Jan
January
%y
%Y	2-digit year

2007
Here is an example.

# print today's date
today <- Sys.Date()
format(today, format="%B %d %Y")
"June 20 2007"

Date Conversion
Character to Date
You can use the as.Date( ) function to convert character data to dates. The format is as.Date(x, "format"), where x is the character data and format gives the appropriate format.

# convert date info in format 'mm/dd/yyyy'
strDates <- c("01/05/1965", "08/16/1975")
dates <- as.Date(strDates, "%m/%d/%Y")

The default format is yyyy-mm-dd

mydates <- as.Date(c("2007-06-22", "2004-02-13"))

Date to Character
You can convert dates to character data using the as.Character( ) function.

# convert dates to character data
strDates <- as.character(dates)
