## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
#Simple Graphs with R

# Define the cars vector with 5 values
cars <- c(2, 5, 6, 3, 8)

# Graph the cars vector with all defaults
plot(cars)

# Graph cars using blue points overlayed by a line 
plot(cars, type="o", col="blue")

# Create a title with a red, bold/italic font
title(main="Autos", col.main="red", font.main=4)

#bar plot
barplot(cars)

#histogram
hist(cars)

## Create a pie chart for cars
pie(cars)
